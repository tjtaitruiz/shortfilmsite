                <p class="project_desc">In addition to short films, our crew has filmed video podcasts and YouTube content. These, while less artsy in nature, provide amazing practice working with camera and sound, performing in front of a camera, and editing multiple camera angles. I also learned how to develop 3D virtual avatars.</p>

                <p class="project_desc">The Warehouse is, as of now, my most professional project. Costume creation, set design, and lighting were a huge part of this project, and I am so proud of the final result.</p>

                <p class="project_desc">Agent Lincoln's Guide to the Universe was the first short film I made with this crew. I wanted to film an infomercial that could set up future short films. This Summer's project is based on this work, and I plan to bring several characters back to demonstrate how much the quality of my work has progressed.</p>

                <p class="project_desc">The Lorax was a play written and constructed with this same crew. Our home town did not have a theater department, but the school started one after this production. It was not professional by any means, but it planted a seed I hope will grow for many years.</p>
