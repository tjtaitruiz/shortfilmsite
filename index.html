            <h2>Low-budget Short Films</h2>
            <p>Making a quality short film is easier than you think! Time and practice are your greatest assets, but there are lots of useful tools to make your job easier as a short filmmaker.</p>

            <p>Making a short film is a tough project. Costumes, cameras, and everything in between can empty your pockets before you blink. What if there was a way to make and obtain everything you need to make a quality short film without breaking the bank? I am no professional-obviously, I'm writing this website-but I have spent years of my life struggling to make memorable short films with homemade resources and affordable equipment. If you are interested, feel free to take a look at my work and read through the things I have learned from my years of selling my soul to set and costume creation, filming, and editing.</p>
